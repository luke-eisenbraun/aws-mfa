Makes the MFA window show on AWS signin

If you or your company uses an MFA token for AWS this will make signing in slightly quicker. Instead of clicking the check-box to show the MFA field the field will now automatically show as well as remove the check-box for easy tabbing. If you choose to show the browser action (icon), you can set your signin url in the options and it will take you there. If you are signed into chrome, the "signin" url will sync across devices.
